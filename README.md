Aspiring Data Scientist | Machine Learning Enthusiast | Passionate about Data-Driven Solutions

🌟 About Me

an aspiring data scientist with a strong foundation in computer science and a deep interest in data-driven problem-solving. My background includes experience in machine learning, neural network, and data visualization, and I'm constantly looking to expand my skills in these areas.

My current focus is on developing predictive models, exploring the potential of large language models, and deploying applications that can solve real-world problems. To make my projects accessible and interactive, I use Flask to deploy machine learning models as web applications, bridging the gap between technical solutions and practical use.

As I work toward my goal of becoming a data scientist, I'm committed to continuous learning and taking on challenges that push my understanding further.

🔍 Areas of Interest:
- Data Science and Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Big Data and Data Engineering
     - Data Cleaning and Preparation
     - Feature Engineering    
Statistical Analysis and Data Visualization

💻 Skills
- Languages & Tools: Python, SQL, Spark, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
